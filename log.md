# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#Day 1: October 28, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Started a new project, added HTML structure and css styling to navbar, showcase section and submit form.

**Thoughts:** It's the first day of this challenge but I've been learning HTML and CSS for exactly a month now. I'm seeing progress in relations to understanding classes better when going through my HTML structure and am thinking in more complex terms when it comes to CSS. For example I feel more confident now with flexbox, grid and also relative and absolute positioning.
